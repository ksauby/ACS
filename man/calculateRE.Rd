\usage{
calculateRE(MSE_ComparisonSamplingDesign, population_data,
  population.grouping.variables, sample.size.variable, rvar, ovar)
}
\arguments{
\item{MSE_ComparisonSamplingDesign}{Sampling design for which relative efficiency (RE) should be calculated.}

\item{MSE_BaselineSamplingDesign}{The sampling design to which the "comparison sampling design" is compared to and its efficiency, relative to this one, is calculated.}

\item{grouping.variables}{Categorical variables identifying the patch realization from which the simulation data was generated (e.g., \code{n.networks} and \code{realization}).}
}
\value{
Dataframe including original data and RE estimates.
